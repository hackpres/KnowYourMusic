## Goal

We have created a website that allows users to connect with their favorite artist's albums and songs. 
Once user is on our homepage (index.html) they will be presented with an authorization to link to their Spotify account.  
Once user signs into their Spotify account on then they will be redirected to our homePage where they will be given the opportunity to enter an artists name, album, or song.  
Then they will be presented with the top 5API returns that best match their input, which then they can select to album or song they want to connect with.

<!-- index.html script.js --->
This is our home page where the user will be asked for authorization to link to their Spotify account.
